# Module Challenge – Web APIs: Code Quiz
## Description
This project is to create an application of typical coding assessment which includes multiple-choice questions.

To be completely honest, I wasn’t able to keep up with the class from the part of DOM events and local storage. During the holiday break, I found out that the issues were not in the knowledge of these two, but the failure of following the logic using functions. It took some time to figure out what functions needed to be included in order to get the quiz rolling to the end.

However, it was quite challenging to even make out what functions can be added to the script for it to flow. So with the help of an article about creating quiz app, I was fortunate to at least refer to the scripts and learned from the logic. When looking at the scripts, I also referred to my own pseudo-coding draft and checked what was missing. Had I not read the article, I wouldn’t have been able to complete the assignment at all!

When doing the assignment, I also learned new things: adding audio, aligning text within buttons, customizing format when appending children items, sorting items in desired order and JSON parse.
